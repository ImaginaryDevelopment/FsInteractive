The purpose of this directory is to consolidate all my reusable code into two possible consumption models that use the same codebase.

1. A script that installs a large portion of the code into somewhere you can easily call it from F# interactive inside Visual Studio
2. A solution that includes code gen translated from my T4 C# into F#
